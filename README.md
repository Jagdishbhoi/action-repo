# GitHub Action Repo - Webhook Simulation

This repository is created to simulate GitHub events (`push`, `pull request`, and `merge`) 
as part of a backend integration challenge involving webhook logging and MongoDB storage.

Each action performed in this repo is captured by the Flask-based `webhook-event-logger` system.

## Key Events Simulated
- ✅ Push Events (via `test_push.py`)
- ✅ Pull Request Events (via `feature-branch/`)
- ✅ Merge Events (via `MERGE_GUIDE.md`)

This repository is linked to: [Webhook Event Logger](https://github.com/Jagdishbhoi/webhook-event-logger)

Built with intent to demonstrate hands-on backend integration using GitHub Webhooks.
